                The goal of this proposal is to identify core safety behaviors, such as hand washing and glove - wearing, in Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) using computer vision techniques to analyze collected videos. The following research activities are proposed in this project:
 <br>1) Label images for object detection and build an object detection database, including gloves, sanitizers, and medical devices, for the use of video analysis; 2) Train the object detection model to identify the safety behaviors; and 3) Examine the reliability and fairness of the object detection model. We will use the 66,048 unique student standardized patient (SP) encounters recorded from 2016 onward that replicated “real - life” workflows. This includes 132,096 videos, corresponding chief complaint information, assessment results, and the medical students’ and SPs’ demographic and other personal - background variables that have been collected, linked with the videos, and are ready to be analyzed. All of the activities will be conducted using Python. The consistency between the developed
object detection model and the SP checklist results will be examined, and the validity evidence will be collected and analyzed for evaluating the assessment tool. We use the background variables to examine whether the detection results are fair across subgroups. It is expected at the application of computer vision technology will enhance the accuracy and precision of simulation - based assessments, optimize the clinical competency learning experience in undergraduate medical education, and make significant and
positive impacts in the field of assessment in the future

The goal of this proposal is to identify core safety behaviors, such as hand washing and glove-wearing, in Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) using computer vision techniques to analyze collected videos. The objectives are two: 1) build an objective detection database, including gloves, sanitizers, and medical devices, for the future use of video analysis, and 2) train an object detection model to identify the safety behaviors for increasing the reliability and validity of assessing safety behaviors in clinical examinations, enhance the accuracy and precision of simulation-based assessments, and optimize the clinical competency learning experience in undergraduate medical education (UME).
