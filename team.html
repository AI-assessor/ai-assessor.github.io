                    Hi, I am interested in specializing as a MD. Outside of school,
                    my hobbies are spending time with family and friends, going to concerts, shopping, and
                    traveling. By engaging in research, I can further my knowledge of science and medicine. My
                    interest of Human Biology, including being pre-med, stems from my goal of the importance of
                    health. Upon completion of my undergraduate studies, I intend to apply to medical school to
                    further my knowledge of biology and progress toward a career as a doctor.

                    During weekends, you'll likely find me 
                    immersed in a hackathon or at the Hatch entrepreneurship center, engaging in discussions about 
                    innovative ideas. I'm a passionate enthusiast for topics like hardware, AI, finance, economics, 
                    and philosophy. In my free time, I enjoy cooking Chinese food, practicing calisthenics, writing 
                    indie music and poetry, and playing the guitar. Leonardo Da Vinci serves as one of my inspirations, 
                    and like him, I compile a list of things I'm curious about or want to learn each week. Additionally, 
                    I have a weakness for snacksâ€”cookies, crackers, and candy are the way to win me over. One of my 
                    notable accomplishments is achieving 444 kills in Minecraft Bedwars on the Hypixel server.

                    I have an interest in computer science, and hope to double major in the near future to 
                    explore a career in cybersecurity. I'm a graduate of Haslett High School, and have been a 
                    local here for about twelve years. I started a club called Arab Cultural Society when I was in 
                    high school, and now enjoy participating in the cultural clubs at MSU. I also like to draw 
                    and sing, and take voice lessons once a week. I'm grateful for this opportunity, and look 
                    forward to being a part of this research project as a clinical investigator!

                    I'm originally from Tampa, Florida. I attended Tampa Bay Technical High School. During my time there 
                    I was enrolled in the academy of health professions and graduated with my 
                    Certified Medical Administrative Assistant (CMAA) and earned the highest score across the program. 
                    Despite being enrolled in the academy of health professions, I collaborated closely with 
                    the head of the computer science department, participating in competitions and building a 
                    foundation of both medical knowledge and technical skills. This experience laid the founded 
                    for my current role at Michigan State University's OMERAD lab, where I seamlessly blend my 
                    medical knowledge and technical skills every day.
