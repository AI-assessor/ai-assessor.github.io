                    Hi, I am interested in specializing as a MD. Outside of school,
                    my hobbies are spending time with family and friends, going to concerts, shopping, and
                    traveling. By engaging in research, I can further my knowledge of science and medicine. My
                    interest of Human Biology, including being pre-med, stems from my goal of the importance of
                    health. Upon completion of my undergraduate studies, I intend to apply to medical school to
                    further my knowledge of biology and progress toward a career as a doctor.

                    During weekends, you'll likely find me 
                    immersed in a hackathon or at the Hatch entrepreneurship center, engaging in discussions about 
                    innovative ideas. I'm a passionate enthusiast for topics like hardware, AI, finance, economics, 
                    and philosophy. In my free time, I enjoy cooking Chinese food, practicing calisthenics, writing 
                    indie music and poetry, and playing the guitar. Leonardo Da Vinci serves as one of my inspirations, 
                    and like him, I compile a list of things I'm curious about or want to learn each week. Additionally, 
                    I have a weakness for snacksâ€”cookies, crackers, and candy are the way to win me over. One of my 
                    notable accomplishments is achieving 444 kills in Minecraft Bedwars on the Hypixel server.
